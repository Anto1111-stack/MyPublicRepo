This a simple game I made as my first python project. The idea came from my job as an order picker in a warehouse. 
The rules are straightforward: The code of the product will flash or blink for short moment and you will have to remember it
and the prompt will ask you to input the number. If the number you input coresponds to the product code program will print out 
a 'Product picked'! statement and if the code is wrong the message will be 'Incorrect code' and 'Game Over'!. 
As my first python project I had issues in figuring out how to loop through python dict and increment the each new 'code promt' and 
all 'if statements' automaticaly instead of copy pasting every new if statement. That is something I have to figure out 
in the future when I revisit this program. I also want to implement a counter for points received and perhaps a second player.
