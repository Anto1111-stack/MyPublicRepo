This is my Public repository where I will push all my projects that are intended to show the level of my programming knowledge and expertise which will evolve over 
time and with high hope one day reach a satisfactory level - that will allow me to get computer programming employment or to be involved in serious personal projects 
with the goal of making a finnished commercial product.
